# bazel-example

## What is this?

This is a bazel example as of 2023 with some pretty normal asks:
* python support (with cross-platform support)
* go support
* OCI images

## TODO

* Get python-c-extensions working (numpy) with hermetic_cc_toolchain
* Add go support + example
* Add k8s and/or helm support
